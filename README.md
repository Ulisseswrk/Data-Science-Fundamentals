## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository represents a different course or learning module. 
All exercises, notes, and references are kept inside their respective folders to ensure clarity and organization.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Folders and Descriptions

- **Basic Python For Data Science**  
  Introductory exercises in Python, focusing on essential programming concepts used in Data Science, such as data types, control structures, functions, and basic data manipulation.

- **Python For Data Science 2**  
  Continuation of Python-focused content for Data Science. It includes more complex structures and external libraries

- **Basic Numpy Numerical Analysis**  
  Hands-on practice with NumPy for baSIC numerical computations and array operations
  
- **Practicing Python and Data Structure**  
  Exercises about Data Sturcture, more specifically, all of the thing i learned on Pyhton For Data Science 2, just to train.

- **Pandas I/O: Working with Multiple File Types and SQL** 
  Exercises on reading and writing data with Pandas from a variety of sources, including CSV, Excel, JSON, HTML, and SQL databases. Emphasis on integrating structured data workflows in real-world Data Science contexts.
